# Deep Learning Models
> As the Keras models are very high in memory, not inculed.

> You can run the notebook provided in this [Github Repo](https://github.com/withMeSaikat/lyme-disease-detector)
> To create the specific models.

> The `app.py` file loads the saved model(in `h5` format) and uses it to predict the output.
